📊 Student Performance Analysis
Data Cleaning in Excel | Dashboarding in Power BI
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes the Student Performance dataset sourced from Kaggle to uncover insights about academic outcomes across gender, parental education, test preparation status, and subject-wise scores.

I performed data cleaning in Microsoft Excel and built an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize patterns and support data-driven decision-making for educators.

📁 Dataset

Source: Kaggle

Dataset Name: Students Performance in Exams

Rows: 1,000+

Features include:

Gender

Race/Ethnicity

Parental education level

📊 Student Performance Analysis<br>
Data Cleaning in Excel | Dashboarding in Power BI
________________________________________
📌 Project Overview<br>
This project analyzes the Student Performance dataset sourced from Kaggle to uncover insights about academic outcomes across gender, parental education, test preparation status, and subject-wise scores.<br>
I performed data cleaning in Microsoft Excel and built an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize patterns and support data-driven decision-making for educators.
